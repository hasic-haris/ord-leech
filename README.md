# ord-leech
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Open-Reaction-Database/ord-data/main/badges/reactions.svg)

The main goal of this mini-project is to facilitate the large-scale downloading and filtering of the chemical reaction 
data from the Open Reaction Database (ORD) repositories.


## The Open Reaction Database (ORD)
The [Open Reaction Database](https://docs.open-reaction-database.org/en/latest/) or ORD is an open access chemical 
reaction database established in 2020 by experts from pharma, academia, and tech. [[1]](#References) According to the 
authors, the main goal of this project is to support machine learning and related efforts in chemical reaction 
prediction, chemical synthesis planning, and experiment design by:
  - Providing a structured data format for chemical reaction data;
  - Providing an interface for easy browsing and downloading of data;
  - Making the reaction data freely and publicly available for anyone to use;
  - Encouraging the sharing of pre-competitive proprietary data, especially high throughput experimentation data;


## Setup Instructions
To start using the `ord-leech`, the project repository needs to be cloned by running:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hasic-haris/ord-leech.git
```

Excluding the `ord-schema` submodule library requirements, the only additionally required library is `tqdm`. Therefore, 
a minimalistic environment can be set up by simply running: 

```shell
conda create -c conda-forge -n ord-leech rdkit
conda activate ord-leech

pip install tqdm
```

The database itself is designed using [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers), which is 
explained and handled in the `ord-schema` repository 
[instructions](https://github.com/open-reaction-database/ord-schema/blob/main/README.md). Accordingly, this project 
contains this repository as a submodule so that the newest changes to the schema can always be easily updated, if 
necessary. The `ord-schema` submodule library requirements can be set up by simply running: 

```shell
pip install -r ord-schema/requirements.txt

python ord-schema/setup.py install
```

After the environment is set up, the database files need to be downloaded. Because the `ord-data` repository handles 
large data files, it requires the usage of [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/). These files can always be downloaded 
dynamically, but in this project the full `ord-data` repository is pre-downloaded to enable offline analysis. The 
installation guidelines for Git LFS can be found [here](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation). The 
repository is cloned by running:

```shell
git lfs clone https://github.com/open-reaction-database/ord-data.git
```

This concludes the setup instructions for this project.
