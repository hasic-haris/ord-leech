This project represents a small Python solution to facilitate the downloading, filtering and formatting of the chemical 
reaction data from the Open Reaction Database (ORD) repositories.

## The Open Reaction Database (ORD)
The [Open Reaction Database](https://docs.open-reaction-database.org/en/latest/) or ORD is an open access chemical reaction 
database established in 2020 by experts from pharma, academia, and tech. [[1]](#References) The main goal of this 
project is to support machine learning and related efforts in chemical reaction prediction, chemical synthesis 
planning, and experiment design by:
  - Providing a structured data format for chemical reaction data;
  - Providing an interface for easy browsing and downloading of data;
  - Making the reaction data freely and publicly available for anyone to use;
  - Encouraging the sharing of pre-competitive proprietary data, especially high throughput experimentation data;

## Git LFS:
Because the ord-data repository handles large data files, it requires the usage of [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/). 
Thus, in order for this project to work, before cloning anything, you need to have it installed. 
You can follow the installation guidelines [here](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Installation).

## Cloning the Repo:
Step 1: Clone the repository. Update the submodules. Install the environment file. Install the ord-schema requirements.
Step 2: LFS clone the ord-data repository.
Step 3: Run the program.
